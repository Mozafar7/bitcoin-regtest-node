To reset the network:
- delete everything in the .bitcoin folder
- restart bitcoind
- create a new wallet
- load the new wallet
- generate a new address for the wallet
- copy this address to the python server and the crontab job
- make sure all devices connected to the network are reset as well (otherwise they do not have matching blockchains)
